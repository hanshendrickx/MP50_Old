# MPOSP stand for MediPrepare Open Source Project
This Project is created by the creator of MediPrepare for the benefit of the health of all human beings.
This Project is an Open Source Project. MPOSP stands for MediPrepare Open Source Project.

# Open Source Medical Expert Knowledge Project
MPOSP is a project to let all doctors at home create their own expert questionnaires with tools to catch their Expert Knowledge. The needed software is open source, MPOSP will teach you how to set up the system on your own PC. 

# For doctors, for programmers
You do not need to be a programmer to codify your Expert Knowledge. The created questions can be shared with all doctors in the world. You can combine the available questions in your own questionnaire. These questionnaires can be used for example to prepare your patients before an appointment, and the resulting data, collected and presented in a format each doctor in the world immediately recognizes, can be used in the whole healthcare-chain. 

# For patients and Doctors
Empowering patients, helping workflows in doctors offices, improving quality of healthcare, 
for all patients, all doctors, at all times, at all places, in all languages.

# Short introductory course to get started
We are creating a 4 hours course, a total of 60 minutes video, and materials to get started. The course will help install: 1. Anaconda, 2. Python and Visual Code MS, 3. Django, 4. Open Source MP to create intelligent questionnaires to build in Expert Knowledge for your patients to prepare for your clinic. All open source software.

# Development of a database for sharing your questions and questionnaires
Our vision is to have a world wide community to create a knowledge base of questions and questionnaires for triage and to prepare patients, help them prepare their own 'casebook', before an appointment, and to jump-start the doctor's thinking process with relevant and important information and context, all created by the patient self. 

# Content
The content is derived from the Evidence Based History Taking, developed over more then 5000 years. The presentation is derived from Medical Context Communication Standards, developed over the last 500 years. 

# General Questionnaires per Specialty
The content is: PII/Anonymous, Age, Sex, Current Complaints including relevant information about its histories, Body Weight, Body Length, Waist to Height Ratio, ASA-score, AHA-score, Beeh-Score, Pack Years, Allergies for medications, chemicals, living creatures, flora, other, Disabilities, Past Medical History, including Organ specific events, Diseases, Syndromes, Symptoms, Signs, Surgeries, Hospital Admissions, Medications, Social Circumstances, Family History, Congenital anomalies, Screening instruments scores, Open questions, longitudinal information, and other relevant information.

# Concrete Questionnaires
Questionnaires can ask specific information about 40.000 diseases, 10.000 symptoms and signs, 5.000 syndromes, psychological and psychiatric issues, 5.000 laboratory tests.

# The development will be in English, and will be translated into all languages
The goal is that medical experts develop single questions or grouped questions, which will be shared by world wide developers. The questions will be exposed to peer review, and submitted to the database of questions. Those questions can be downloaded for use in questionnaires at local level.

# Online use and intranet use
The questions can be developed on local or home PCs on local development environments. For production environments local clinics should create their own IT-environment. Our goal is to have containers available for quick installation of standard servers.

# Thanks to all supporters from all over the world

# For funding of our activities we depend on gifts

# History
The ideas for MediPrepare are rooted in over 50 years of experiences of Dr. Hans Hendrickx. He was introduced to Algol-60 in the sixties, statistical analysis and simulations in FORTRAN per computer in the seventies, clinical use of computers in the early 80-ties. While working at Department of CCM of Pittsburgh University Hospitals and the Resuscitation Research Center of Prof. Peter Safar he learned about Caduceus, the first medical EK-project of programmer Pople and Meyers MD, and since then became impressed by the force of such coupling of expertise. During the first decennium of this century he traveled all over the world to find an IT-tool to create his vision. Although many systems seemed promising, he did not find exactly what he envisioned. At last he got in touch with Tom Blauwendraat, a physicist-programmer, who said we better create this ourselves. After 10 years MediPrepare was ready for a good demo-project, which was successful. However, funding turned out to be very difficult. At that point Dr Hans decided to go open source and democratize medicine through the route of Open Source.
