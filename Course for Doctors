# MPOSP-2 Expert Knowledge In Medicine Course
Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability. William Osler

# Why this course?
This quote by one of the ground fathers of modern medicine still is very true. In one line it coins the challenges of doctors 
and explains to lay people why medicine can only properly be practiced after long and intensive training.
That is needed to become an expert and explains why it is so difficult for programmers to develop meaningful software 
for doctors and patients. Programmers like logic and certainties, doctors like that as well, 
however are forced to find their way in an uncertain world.

This course is intended to give tools to doctor-programmer teams to help develop just that, to overcome this challenge 
to develop good medical software that helps doctors and patients. It intends to learn doctors to understand how programmers 
like to work, and programmers to learn how doctors have to work to solve the challenges of solving uncertainties.

# What are the elements of this course?
MPOSP-2 helps doctors to set up their computer with software used by over 6 million scientists all over the world: 
1. Python-Anaconda. Anaconda makes hundreds of programs for data science available for non-programmers, and is a friendly 
user interface for creating containers to work in, and to exchange code. From within Anaconda many tools become available 
for data analysis, machine learning, statistics, including R. 
2. Python-Django is used by millions of programmers to quickly develop websites, small or large, and full business sites. 
It is the best documented full stack web development system. Build on Django, we will install Wagtail CMS.
3. MPOSP-2 open source project is a system to develop question-pages, which can be linked into questionnaires, 
up to 2000+ questions. By making use of logic these questionnaires become dynamic and intelligent. More importantly, 
doctors can build their Expert Knowledge into these questions and questionnaires. This makes it possible to develop 
a differential diagnostic system for used by lay people, up to a point, and doctors, up to a point.
4. MPOSP-2 open source project has also created a system to report the answers and choices into a 'Casebook', 
a report page, PDF and JSON Database, which is based on the Medical History Taking tradition of doctors 
for over 5000 years, and codified in a systematic report standard for over 500 years.

Doctors can create intelligent questions, combine them in intelligent questionnaires, and create an intelligent 
'Casebook' for communication. Patients can prepare their case in a professional way, and doctors save a lot of time by getting 
a full context and case-description, in all languages, at all places, for all people. Patients generate the 'Casebook'
anonymously or with all PII, they own, they share, they create.

# Modern IT makes this possible.
